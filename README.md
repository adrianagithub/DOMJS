This was the first idea of one prototype that I was planning to develop to help people facing Domestic Violence.
This is a page where you can register and invite people to DV meetings.
This version was developed with Java Script, HTML, CSS.
After I took my Ruby on Rails bootcamp I develop the first version of the prototype.
You can find the first version of the prototype in this repository.
